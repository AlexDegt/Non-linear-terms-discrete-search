# Simulation parameters
# Chebyshev polynomal order
param_num: [3, 3]
# Specifies range of possible delays to be chosen for the input signal.
# List includes [first, last, step] possible delays
delays_range: [-6, 6, 3]
# Number of OLS iterations. Each new iteration corresponds to 1 new model branch.
iter_num: 5
batch_size: 1
# Whole signal length 213504, half 106752
block_size: 106752
# chunk_num is important parameter, which allows to divide whole signal
# into chunk_num blocks. LS method is implemented to accumulate 
# hessian and gradient along the whole signal length and save GPU memory.
# Increase this parameter if you obtain out of memory error.
