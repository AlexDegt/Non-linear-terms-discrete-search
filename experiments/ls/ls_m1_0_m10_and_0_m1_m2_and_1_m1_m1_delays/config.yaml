# Model is parallel Chebyshev polynomials, summed at the output
# Each polynomail is fed by the signals x_n, delayd by delay

# Whole signal length 213504, half 106752

# chunk_num is important parameter, which allows to divide whole signal
# into chunk_num blocks. LS method is implemented to accumulate 
# hessian and gradient along the whole signal length and save GPU memory.
# Increase this parameter if you obtain out of memory error.
