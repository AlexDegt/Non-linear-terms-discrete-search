# Simulation parameters
# Chebyshev polynomal order
param_num: [6, 6]
# Model is parallel Chebyshev polynomials, summed at the output
# Each polynomail is fed by the signals x_n, delayd by delay
# delays: [[0, -3, 0]]
delays: [[0, 0, -1]]
batch_size: 1
# Whole signal length 99840
block_size: 99840
# chunk_num is important paracmeter, which allows to divide whole signal
# into chunk_num blocks. LS method is implemented to accumulate 
# hessian and gradient along the whole signal length and save GPU memory.
# Increase this parameter if you obtain out of memory error.
